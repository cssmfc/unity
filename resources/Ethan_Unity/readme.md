# Ethan - From White to Colored #
Ethan is a 3rd person character which comes with Unity's Standard Assets, unfortunateley comes in white and gray.

This package is ment to change that, add a bit of color to Ethan.


## How to use ##
- create new material and add your favorite version of texture to both Albedo and Occlusion
- assign the new matterial to EthanBody

Only the EthanOcclusion# was edited not the normal map so no need to replace that, it can stay as it is, the default one.

Might not be the best resources but I like a spot of color in my projects.
Default is EthanOcclusion.png (the white texture) EthanNormals.png the same 
My fav one is [EthanOcclusion2.png](https://github.com/cssmfc/unity/blob/master/resources/Ethan_Unity/Textures/EthanOcclusion2.png), first one I made and also most detailed

All Unity's brand elements and logo are not removed (chest, glove, snikers)

Emmm... I could not find the Eyes graphic element in main/default texture so if you remove the glasses, don't be afraid :D
